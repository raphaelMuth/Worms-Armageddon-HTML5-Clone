/**
 * InstructionChain.js
 *
 * NOTICE: all varible names are extremely obsure and short for packet size reasons.
 *
 * This little beauty allows me functionality like eval, but with scope safety.
 * It allows the user to pass a string of method calls on objects. This is used mainly
 * for excuting commands on connected game clients in a safe way, its a little open to
 * cheating but I have other ways to lock that down, which I won't explain here
 * as this code is viewable on GitHub :)
